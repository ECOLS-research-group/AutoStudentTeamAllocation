Auto Student Team Allocation [case study of a software engineering course]

Copyright (c) 2018, Anuraganand Sharma - All rights reserved.

This Matlab code is the implementation of Auto Student Team Allocation for a software engineering course, perceived and coded by Anuraganand Sharma for the paper:
Nand, R., Sharma, A., Reddy, K., “Skill-Based Group Allocation of Students for Project-Based Learning Courses Using Genetic Algorithm: Weighted Penalty Model,” in 2018 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering (TALE), 2018, pp. 394–400.

How to run:
1 - Only the code for the objective function is given.
2 - Use this objective function for your choice of a meta-heuristic algorithm. 
3 - You may change/add weighting of the skill set.
